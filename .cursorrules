# Cursor Rules for PhotoSlide Project

## Project Focus
This project is focused exclusively on the PhotoSlide Flask application.

## Code Context Guidelines
- When making changes, focus only on the relevant files for the task
- Avoid loading entire file contents unless necessary
- Prefer reading specific sections of files using line offsets
- Use grep/search tools to find specific code patterns before reading full files

## File Priorities
- Core application files: app.py, templates/*.html
- Configuration: requirements.txt, .gitignore
- Data files: data/result_config.json (small, can be included)

## Files to Ignore
- All uploaded images in static/uploads/
- Virtual environment (venv/)
- Cache files (__pycache__/, *.pyc)
- Log files (*.log)
